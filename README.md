# docker-le-router

Please do not judge harshly. This repository was created for entertainment purposes. Here you will find an attempt to 
organize access to your web projects through a reverse terminating proxy that automatically updates Let's Encrypt 
certificates. Clearly, all of this can be done through Traefik and in many other ways, but I was interested in doing 
this using Docker websockets and Go templating. All of this is an experiment that will allow you to understand how 
everything works and can be used in small projects as well.
